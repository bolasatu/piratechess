I have Damian Lemos double finachetto system and c4 deep dive courses, and neither one covers the dutch, and it is labelled as a complete repertoire.  Simply ridiculous!!!",

It's like you said: if they label it as a complete repertoire, then there is no excuse from omitting the Dutch. It's not that they are absolute beginners and never heared about the Dutch, right? So omitting the Dutch and claiming to have a complete repertoire only means one thing: they are only interested in your money and don't care if you only buy one repertoire.

                            "comment":"I know that the course only covers 1.Nf3, 1.d4, and 1.c4, thus I am very humbly asking what I am asking: I wonder about other first moves, like what to play against these so that the transposition into the repertoire is likely (to avoid learning new openings and have the ability to re-use ideas). <br\/><br\/>I am asking since I want to make the repertoire into my main repertoire. I am very serious about studying it. I have tried \u201c1\u2026b6 against everything\u201d earlier and have played it for many years which seems to have a similar idea to the benoni course: prevent full center or if it happens be in a position to attack it. This benoni course seems to adopt a more direct approach to preventing the full center right from the beginning. It is actually amazing this can be done in 120 lines. Of course the price I had to pay is that I have to learn the Alekhine too, which I started. Anway, back to the question.<br\/><br\/>There seems to be three key rules that govern the move order in the benoni course:<br\/>r0 is maybe same as rule r3 - never allow the full center d4 &amp; c4<br\/>r1 - default move order is 1...Nf6 2...g6 3...Bg7 (if white does not do something in the center)<br\/>r2 - with d4 and Nc3 with c-pawn still on c2 =&gt; stop e4 with ...d5!<br\/>r3 - if our c pawn is still on c7 =&gt; never allow c4 &amp; d4-d5 push<br\/><br\/>Below I list the moves I wonder about with lichess statistics. I provide the statistics about how often they are played at 1600-1800 level (note that when compared to 1.c4 other rare moves are not so rare):<br\/>1.d4 26% =&gt; 1\u2026Nf6; covered in the course<br\/>1.c4 4% =&gt; 1\u2026Nf6; covered in the course<br\/>1.Nf3 3% =&gt; 1\u2026Nf6; covered in the course<br\/>1.e3 3% =&gt; 1\u2026Nf6; suppose white wants to play d4 next but 2.e4 will be unlikely next (since it will be a loss of tempo) so 1\u2026Nf6 seems to lead to a likely transposition. Am I thinking correctly here?<br\/>1.g3 2% =&gt; 1\u2026Nf6 2.Bg2 91% =&gt; 2\u2026g6; I found a game on lichess by Bryan that was relatively recent so I suppose 1\u2026Nf6 is ok. That would be following r1.<br\/>1.b3 2% =&gt; 1\u2026Nf6; So white goes for direct nimzo-larsen (not the delayed one covered in the course). Seems that 1\u2026Nf6 will lead to a likely transposition after 2\u2026g6 and 3\u2026Bg7. Am I thinking correctly here in the spirit of the course?<br\/>1.b4 1% =&gt; 1\u2026Nf6; just for the sake of memorization it seems easiest to follow rule r1. Is this reasonable?<br\/>1.Nc3 1% =&gt; ?; Here I think that 1\u2026Nf6 is not the best as white can get 2.e4 which seems to break a key rule in the course: never allow early e4 (r0 and r2). I really wonder what to play here. it seems that 1\u2026d4 or 1\u2026c4 would be better but I am not sure. Seems that with 1.Nc3 we cannot stop white playing 2.e4. Would 1\u2026Nf6 still be acceptable?<br\/>1.c3 0% =&gt; 1\u2026Nf6; presume that this is another way to ensure easy 2.d4. Suppose there is nothing wrong with following rule r1. Am I thinking correctly?<br\/><br\/>I am curious about how one thinks when considering responses to the first moves by white that are listed above. Again, I know that every course has a limited scope as chess is extremely complex and one course cannot cover it all. Thus, I am asking very humbly what I am asking.<br\/>",

                            "originalComment":"I know that the course only covers 1.Nf3, 1.d4, and 1.c4, thus I am very humbly asking what I am asking: I wonder about other first moves, like what to play against these so that the transposition into the repertoire is likely (to avoid learning new openings and have the ability to re-use ideas). \n\nI am asking since I want to make the repertoire into my main repertoire. I am very serious about studying it. I have tried \u201c1\u2026b6 against everything\u201d earlier and have played it for many years which seems to have a similar idea to the benoni course: prevent full center or if it happens be in a position to attack it. This benoni course seems to adopt a more direct approach to preventing the full center right from the beginning. It is actually amazing this can be done in 120 lines. Of course the price I had to pay is that I have to learn the Alekhine too, which I started. Anway, back to the question.\n\nThere seems to be three key rules that govern the move order in the benoni course:\nr0 is maybe same as rule r3 - never allow the full center d4 &amp; c4\nr1 - default move order is 1...Nf6 2...g6 3...Bg7 (if white does not do something in the center)\nr2 - with d4 and Nc3 with c-pawn still on c2 =&gt; stop e4 with ...d5!\nr3 - if our c pawn is still on c7 =&gt; never allow c4 &amp; d4-d5 push\n\nBelow I list the moves I wonder about with lichess statistics. I provide the statistics about how often they are played at 1600-1800 level (note that when compared to 1.c4 other rare moves are not so rare):\n1.d4 26% =&gt; 1\u2026Nf6; covered in the course\n1.c4 4% =&gt; 1\u2026Nf6; covered in the course\n1.Nf3 3% =&gt; 1\u2026Nf6; covered in the course\n1.e3 3% =&gt; 1\u2026Nf6; suppose white wants to play d4 next but 2.e4 will be unlikely next (since it will be a loss of tempo) so 1\u2026Nf6 seems to lead to a likely transposition. Am I thinking correctly here?\n1.g3 2% =&gt; 1\u2026Nf6 2.Bg2 91% =&gt; 2\u2026g6; I found a game on lichess by Bryan that was relatively recent so I suppose 1\u2026Nf6 is ok. That would be following r1.\n1.b3 2% =&gt; 1\u2026Nf6; So white goes for direct nimzo-larsen (not the delayed one covered in the course). Seems that 1\u2026Nf6 will lead to a likely transposition after 2\u2026g6 and 3\u2026Bg7. Am I thinking correctly here in the spirit of the course?\n1.b4 1% =&gt; 1\u2026Nf6; just for the sake of memorization it seems easiest to follow rule r1. Is this reasonable?\n1.Nc3 1% =&gt; ?; Here I think that 1\u2026Nf6 is not the best as white can get 2.e4 which seems to break a key rule in the course: never allow early e4 (r0 and r2). I really wonder what to play here. it seems that 1\u2026d4 or 1\u2026c4 would be better but I am not sure. Seems that with 1.Nc3 we cannot stop white playing 2.e4. Would 1\u2026Nf6 still be acceptable?\n1.c3 0% =&gt; 1\u2026Nf6; presume that this is another way to ensure easy 2.d4. Suppose there is nothing wrong with following rule r1. Am I thinking correctly?\n\nI am curious about how one thinks when considering responses to the first moves by white that are listed above. Again, I know that every course has a limited scope as chess is extremely complex and one course cannot cover it all. Thus, I am asking very humbly what I am asking.\n",

I already have the opening-oddities course (the book only, not the video version). Seems that the opening oddities repertoire is very different from this 1...Nf6 based repertoire. For example, against 1.c4 in the opening oddities you are suggesting 1\u2026e5, against 1.Nc3 =&gt; 1\u2026d5 so very different from 1\u2026Nf6. Also, for other rare lines it seems you are avoiding 1\u2026Nf6 too. For example, against 1.e3 you are suggesting 1...e4; against 1.g3 =&gt; 1...d5 or 1...e5, etc. This seems like a completely new repertoire and 400+ lines extra to learn.

Judging by your response, seems the answer is \"no\" but maybe this is so if black is aiming for an advantage or is trying to punish white's weak opening play.

The Barry Attack is named after Sir Henry Thomas Barry (1830\u20131880), an Irish chess player who played a key role in popularizing this particular chess opening.<br\/><br\/>The Barry Attack is a chess opening that arises after the moves:<br\/><br\/>d4 d5<br\/>Nf3 Nf6<br\/>c4<br\/>The idea is to later play cxd5, exchanging pawns in the center and aiming to create an imbalanced pawn structure. The name \"Barry Attack\" simply refers to the opening's association with Sir Henry Thomas Barry and its aggressive nature rather than any positive or negative connotation of the word \"barry\" in slang.<br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/>",

                            "originalComment":"I asked chat GPT:\nNo, the term \"Barry Attack\" in chess does not have its roots in the British slang meaning of \"barry\" as something very good or excellent. The Barry Attack is named after Sir Henry Thomas Barry (1830\u20131880), an Irish chess player who played a key role in popularizing this particular chess opening.\n\nThe Barry Attack is a chess opening that arises after the moves:\n\nd4 d5\nNf3 Nf6\nc4\nThe idea is to later play cxd5, exchanging pawns in the center and aiming to create an imbalanced pawn structure. The name \"Barry Attack\" simply refers to the opening's association with Sir Henry Thomas Barry and its aggressive nature rather than any positive or negative connotation of the word \"barry\" in slang.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I personally also had a bad score vs the g6 line, but that was because I only studied that line superficially. For example, I often tried to attack on the kingside when the course obviously shows it is time to play b4 and play on the queenside. <br\/><br\/>This is the thing about an opening like the Trompowsky. We are seeking to play unconventional chess, only to then be surprised when our conventional means don\u2019t fit the bill. I believe it is only natural that this takes some time to get used to, but once you do, your opponents will be the ones quickly getting lost. ",

I personally also had a bad score vs the g6 line, but that was because I only studied that line superficially. For example, I often tried to attack on the kingside when the course obviously shows it is time to play b4 and play on the queenside. \n\nThis is the thing about an opening like the Trompowsky. We are seeking to play unconventional chess, only to then be surprised when our conventional means don\u2019t fit the bill. I believe it is only natural that this takes some time to get used to, but once you do, your opponents will be the ones quickly getting lost. ",

Against 1 Nf3 you are right that 1...Nf6 should be the move played. The point is that the author suggests 1 c4 c5 as a choice against 1 c4 (only he suggests it via 1 Nf3 c5 2 c4 Nc6, but it will transpose later to the same positions as Black inevitably plays ...Nf6) and after 1 Nf3 Nf6 you are still ready for that tranposition in case he decides to play 2 c4.\r<br\/>This also solves your problem with 1 c4, as then 1...c5 is covered in the repertoire.\r<br\/>After 1 g3 you are a bit left on your own, but here you will have to make a decision on your own what type of position you'd like to play. 1...c5 allows various Sicilian transpositions after 2 e4, 1...d5 would most likely be a Reti, 1...e5 can transpose to an English after 2 c4 while 1...Nf6 keeps all the options open, but you will have the same choices after 2 Bg2. This is all I can do here, to show you the options, as the decision needs to be done based on your preferences.\r<br\/>Hope this helps.\r<br\/>Alex\r<br\/>\r<br\/>",

                                  "originalComment":"While this is more a question for the author, as you're asking for suggestions that would keep in line with the proposed repertoire, I'll try to give you a few suggestions.\r\nI checked the Benko repertoire and the lines the author suggest against lines that may transpose after certain move-orders. Against 1 Nf3 you are right that 1...Nf6 should be the move played. The point is that the author suggests 1 c4 c5 as a choice against 1 c4 (only he suggests it via 1 Nf3 c5 2 c4 Nc6, but it will transpose later to the same positions as Black inevitably plays ...Nf6) and after 1 Nf3 Nf6 you are still ready for that tranposition in case he decides to play 2 c4.\r\nThis also solves your problem with 1 c4, as then 1...c5 is covered in the repertoire.\r\nAfter 1 g3 you are a bit left on your own, but here you will have to make a decision on your own what type of position you'd like to play. 1...c5 allows various Sicilian transpositions after 2 e4, 1...d5 would most likely be a Reti, 1...e5 can transpose to an English after 2 c4 while 1...Nf6 keeps all the options open, but you will have the same choices after 2 Bg2. This is all I can do here, to show you the options, as the decision needs to be done based on your preferences.\r\nHope this helps.\r\nAlex\r\n\r\n",

Nf3 c5 is only there because of an illustrative game presented in the repertoire which happened to lead to a familiar position via transposition. So answering 1 c4 with 1...c5 is not necessarily Chessexplained's suggestion, although I also came to the conclusion that this move gives Black the best chance to get to a position contained in the repertoire.\r<br\/>Now to the line 1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 c5.  Is the knight really always best placed on f6? If White omits d4 in the near future, I feel like it might be desirable for Black to not have the knight already on f6 and go for a quick ...g6 and ...Bg7 to control the long diagonal.

                                  "comment":"Hi semisimple. I like to play 1...c5 against 1.Nf3. I am not scared of a transposition to the Sicilian, because I play it anyways (since a few weeks, I fell in love with the Najdorf - the repertoire from GM Leitao) against 1.e4.  If White continues with c4 and d4, then we will return to the repertoire (where White tries to avoid the Benko). If White plays 2.d4 then 2.Nf6 gets us back to the repertoire. If White wants to play an English with a kingside fianchetto, then I still have the option to play a Botvinnik structure, or a setup with a kingside fianchetto with also ..e6 and ..Nge7. Postponing the move 1..Nf6 has benefits, I think. There is not that much that White can do to make my life uncomfortable. If White starts with 1.c4, I just play 1..e5 with the theory that is also available on this site and only has around 80 variations, so still manageable as an answer to 1.c4. In my point of view, the Benko really fits in with a Sicilian repertoire. You need to learn something against 1.e4 anyways. Whatever option you choose, it will require some study. If it is 1..e5 or 1..e6 or any other repertoire you should choose, you need to study the theory. There are several Sicilian repertoires available on this site that could suite your style. The Benko is an active opening. A Sicilian like the Najdorf or the Sveshnikov (or even an (Hyper) Accelerated Dragon) fits in nicely. Complemented with the repertoire 1.c4 e5 I have (almost) no holes, nothing serious that required much additional work. I do have to admit that I also play the English with White, according to the repertoire from chessexplained on this site. For me, all those openings have something in common and there are many overlapping themes.",

Not to confuse with the famous pianist Vladimir Horowitz, who maybe was playing the 1.d4 e6, too, in case he played the game of chess.
