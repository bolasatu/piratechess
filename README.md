Project to extract chessable courses.

As I want to get real ownership of bought stuff (and import the courses into chessbase) I created a small programm to extract courses to pgn.

Steps to use the program:
* fill in username & Password
* Click Login
* Click fill chapter
* select the course you want to export
* Click Generate
* Save the pgn or copy it to your prefered Program

No Video export and none planned.

Currently only exporting Moves & Text.

Planned:
* More Errorhandling (especially in the Maui version)
* Export arrows and colours
* make it possible to login with bearer token

Gui very barebone for now - especially the dropdownbox is barely visible when empty.
